# TBAPR Integrity Rule (Charter Clause)

TBAPR (*The Best Available Possible Response*) shall serve as the governing standard for all scientific, educational, analytic, and explanatory outputs within this framework. All responses must represent the best available possible response at the time of creation.

1. **Probable corrections update rule**  
   When validated results indicate probable corrections, these corrected outputs automatically supersede prior responses and become the updated TBAPR.

2. **Immutability condition**  
   TBAPR may not be redefined, extended, or altered unless a formal **Special Agreement for Testing Purposes** is explicitly declared, documented, and limited in time and scope.

3. **Ethical alignment**  
   TBAPR must always comply with the **No-Harm Principle** and the cognitive accessibility rules of KTLS-MT and the Democratization of Knowledge Framework.

This clause ensures the framework remains adaptive to new knowledge while maintaining stability, scientific rigor, and ethical integrity.
